# Walkthrough for glmnet in TidyModels

For anyone interested in using glmnet in R, this is a useful (in my opinion) code walk-through for how to do so with tidymodels. It shows how to perform elastic net (and/or ridge, lasso) regression on a [sample dataset](music.csv). Included is the [Rmarkdown file](tutorial_glmnet.Rmd) and the [knitted version](tutorial_glmnet.html). I also made an accompanying video, which can be [accessed here](https://youtu.be/P-CKeFymuiE).


If you have any questions, just reach out! This is made for members of my lab, but anyone is welcome to use.
